# mnist_digit_classifier

Keras, Pytorch, and custom (from scratch) implementations.

The from scratch implementation is a 3 layer
network (784, 128, 10). It is getting 97% accuracy
at the moment.

A modification I will work on is changing the loss
function from mean squared error to cross-entropy,
and the output layer activation from sigmoid to softmax.
