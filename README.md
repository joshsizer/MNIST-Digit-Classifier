# mnist_digit_classifier

Keras, Pytorch, and custom (from scratch) implementations.

The from scratch implementation is a 3 layer
network (784, 128, 10). It is currently at 97% accuracy.

Two things I could change to improve is swapping the loss
function from mean squared error to cross-entropy,
and the output layer activation from sigmoid to softmax.
